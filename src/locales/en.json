  "AboutText": "Under the supervision of the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers (National Data Center), and designed and implemented by the General Company for Electronic Systems, an electronic platform known as the 'National Bank of Stagnant and Slow-Moving Materials' was established. This platform aims to improve resource management in government institutions by creating an integrated and comprehensive information system for stagnant and slow-moving materials available in the warehouses of state institutions, which are no longer needed in one institution but can be utilized and employed in others.",
  "AboutText2": "This platform was created to address a critical problem faced by government institutions in Iraq related to the accumulation of materials in warehouses, resulting from the lengthy and complex procedures for handling stagnant materials"
